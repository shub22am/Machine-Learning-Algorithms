# Predicting the Heart disease of Patients using Machine-Learning-Algorithms
The aim of this project is to predict the heart disease of a patients, depending upon the
features given in a dataset. Using Supervised ML algorithms evaluating the features and
building the models of the project.
Finally, we are able to predicted the heart diseases of a patients with one of our
applied modelâ€™s logistic regression, decision tree and random forest and considering the
same as our best performer.
